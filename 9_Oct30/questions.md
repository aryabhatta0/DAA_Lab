### ðŸ“Œ **Q3. Maximum Speed to Grandma's City**

Mary is very, very happy. You would be happy, too, if your parents gave you the latest model BMW for your birthday. She wants to try out her new car, so she is going to visit her grandma.

There is a graph with **N** vertices representing **N** cities and **M** edges representing bidirectional roads between some pairs of cities. We can assume that Mary lives in City 1 and her grandma lives in City N.

Unfortunately, not everything is so good in life and examples are the speed limits. Mary decided to drive with permanent speed. Each of these **M** roads has a maximum permissible speed **v** that Mary canâ€™t exceed.

Well, her whims donâ€™t end here. As a lover of extreme experiences, she wants to drive her expensive car as fast as possible.

You are to write a program to find the **maximum speed** at which Mary can reach her grandmaâ€™s city without arguing with the policemen (for their own good).

### âœ… Example:

```
N = 4, M = 5

u v weight     u v weight
1 2   80       4 3   300
3 1   20       2 4   90
2 3   60

Output: 80
```
